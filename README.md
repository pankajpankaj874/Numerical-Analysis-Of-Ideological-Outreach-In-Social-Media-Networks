# Numerical-Analysis-Of-Ideological-Outreach-In-Social-Media-Networks

The goal of this project is to develop a numerical simulation model that analyzes the process of ideological outreach within social media networks. By employing numerical methods, this project seeks to find  the mechanisms and patterns through which various ideologies spread across social media platforms, enabling the formulation of informed strategies to understand and engage with these processes effectively.
